CitySecrets is a photo-driven web app for exploring little-known features of cities you live in or visit. It was made using React/Redux for the frontend and Mongo/Node/Express for the backend, and tested with Mocha/Chai.

## Get Started
1. Fork and clone the repo, along with the `city-secrets-server` repo.
1. Run `npm i` inside the directory to install all the necessary packages.
1. In a new terminal window, run the server from the `city-secrets-server` repo (follow the directions in the repo's README - run Mongo, then run the server).
1. Run `npm start` in this repo's directory to open the web app in your default web browser.
